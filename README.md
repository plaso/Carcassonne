Carcassone is a turn-based game (in this web adaptation is for two players) where each turn a player has a piece of ground that they should place in order to keep creating the final board. Each time a player close a castle, he gets a point. The game finish when there are no more pieces to place.

The design of the game is based on Clash Royale aesthetics.
